# Overview
You've been tasked to create a website that displays information above movies. Your team lead has suggested using a public-facing API for accessing movie data and has signed up for https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase.

# Task
Take a copy/fork of this repo to create a website with React and the Nextjs framework to display the movie data. You have complete flexibility on the design and can style it how you see fit.

You can register for an API key for free but if you're not comfortable doing that please contact Signapse to provide you with one. 

## What needs to be completed

- Build a website that displays movie data from a public API using React, Typescript and Nextjs
- Ensure that all code is tested with a testing framework of your choice
- Implement linting with a linting tool of your choice
- Use a UI framework like Tailwinds

## Bonus points
If you have additional time for bonus points please add the following:

- Use Storybook to create components that can be viewed and developed in isolation
- Document your decisions

This task should take no longer than an hour to complete and if you have any issues or questions please feel free to get in contact.
